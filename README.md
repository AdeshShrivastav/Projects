Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:


Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To use the model for predicting laptop prices, follow these steps:

Ensure your dataset is in the correct format (CSV file with appropriate columns).
Run the prediction script:
python predict.py --input data/laptops.csv --output results/predictions.csv

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model includes various features such as:

Brand
Processor Type
RAM Size
Storage Capacity
Screen Size
Operating System
Price
Ensure your dataset is clean and preprocessed before training the model.

Model
The model is built using the following machine learning techniques:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
Model Training: Using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Results
The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on a test dataset. The results are as follows:

Mean Absolute Error: 500
Mean Squared Error: 1000000
R-squared: 0.85
